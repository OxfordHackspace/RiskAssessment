# RiskAssessment
Risk assessments for the Oxhack tools. These are based on the STFC risk assessment format, and the pro-formas for these can be found [here] (http://www.she.stfc.ac.uk/SHE/resources/word/SC06Appendix2c.doc). 

#Hazard Posters
These posters can be applied to the wall adjacent to the relevant tool, and are designed to highlight the relevant hazards and mitigations that have been applied to that item. Update as appropriate.
